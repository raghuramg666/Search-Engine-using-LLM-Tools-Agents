# Search Engine using LLM Tools and Agents

## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in building an advanced search engine using tools and agents. The system combines the power of natural language processing and tool integration to provide precise and intelligent search results.

---

## Features
- Integration with LLMs for enhanced search capabilities.
- Use of tools and agents to refine and execute search queries.
- Includes a Jupyter Notebook for experimentation and demonstration.

---

## Project Structure
- `app.py`: The main application script for running the search engine.
- `tools_agent.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook showcasing the integration and functionality of LLM tools and agents.

---

## Requirements
To run this project, you will need the following:
- Python 3.8 or above
- Required Python libraries (listed in `requirements.txt`, if available)

---

## Setup and Usage

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd Search-Engine-using-LLM-Tools-Agents-main
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Install the required Python libraries:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the Application
Execute the main script:
```bash
python app.py
```

### 4. Experiment with the Notebook
